# cse6250_project

## Dependencies
You should be able to use the sunlab "bigbox" Docker container, and the environment.yml from Homework 5. If you have trouble with Python packages during execution (talos, etc), try running pip install --upgrade for the offending packages. See 'requirements.txt' for a pip freeze at the time of submission.

## Data
Pre-trained models are not included, but the original models are available from the original paper. You will need to download the 100D Glove embedding data also, as it was too large to upload to GitHub. Data is already preprocessed.

## Instructions
Ensure you have downloaded the GLoVE embedding data into 'glove.6B/glove.6B.100d.txt'. Then, you should be able to simply run 'python h1.py' and 'python h2.py' respectively.
